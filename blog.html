                <p class="title">Usage of Relative Size</p>
                <article>
                    <p>Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ?</p>
                    <p>There are different opinions about this topic regarding using %, px, em or rem. So, some recommend pixels to be used when you don't want something to be scaled. But also interfere with zoon functionality and is not responsive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Percentages is recommended to be used when you want to scale based on the parent property. We use rem with most of properties because it is consistent regardless of their usage. EM should be used while scaling property based on the size of the element.</p>
                    <p> All of them has srong side. But what most stands out is em because the size relates to the screen size which make it look fitted whether in small screen or big screen.

                <p class="title">The difference between Browser pixel and Pixel in CSS</p>
                <article>
                    <p>We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px? 
                        How does the browser interpret that?</p>
                    <p>Pixels are a unit screen measurement. The pixel in browsers show screen resolution and the pixels in CSS show the length of a display area. The pixel (px) in CSS is an angular measurement. 
                        It is relative to the resolution of the viewing device. So, the referential pixel is the angle of one pixel on a device with pixel density of 96 dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm’s length (the average length is 28 inches).
                    </p>
                    <img src="./asset/image/Capture.PNG" alt="[Right angled triangle, opp = 1/192 in, adj = 28 in]" id="triangle">
                    <p id="tan">Tan (α) = opposite /adjacent<br>
                        Tan (α) = ((1/96) / 2) / 28<br>
                        tan (α) = (1/192) / 28<br>
                        tan (α) = 1/5376<br>
                        α = arc tan (1/5376)<br>
                        </p>
                        <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>Since α is only the half angle we want to find the value of we double the value. So we get:</p>
                    <p>α = arc tan (1/5376) * 2</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we have formulas to convert between radians and pixels.</p>
